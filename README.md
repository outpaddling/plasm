PLASM
=====

PLASM is a portable assembler engine designed to assemble any source language
to machine language given a module describing the syntax and instruction
format.

It was developed primarily as a teaching tool for use with EPC, the
Educational Personal Computer simulator, and PAPP, the Portable
Assembly-language Preprocessor.
